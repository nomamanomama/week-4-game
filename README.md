Star Wars RPG

This role-play game begins with an intro screen and a "Start New Game" button. After clicking the start button, 4 characters are displayed. Each player begins with health points (displayed below the character picture) and attack power and counter-attack power (not-displayed). The user selects one of the characters as his role character. The remaining characters become available opponents. The user then selects an opponent to battle, the defender. The user attacks the defender by clicking the "Attack" button. The health points of the defender are reduced by the user character's attack power. The user character's health points are reduced by the defender's attack power. With each attack, the user character's attack power increases by a base amount. When one of the player's health points is reduced to zero or below, the battle is ended. If the user character wins the battle another opponenet must be selected to battle. The game continues until all opponents are defeated or the user is defeated.
